        <p>You are at an exciting time in your life, and we are here to help you celebrate. A you just go engaged you probably need to get some pictures. You would at least need some for your wedding announcements. You will of course want a good picture of you new ring! We have our ideas of more traditional engagement photos, but we would also love if you any special poses you would like us to take of you guys. We can even recreate or even be there for your proposal; we will be stealthy, and they won't even know we are there.</p>
